Multithreaded Chat Application in Java

This project is a simple Multithreaded Chat Application developed using Java that enables real-time communication between multiple clients through a centralized server. The application follows the client–server architecture, where one instance of the program runs as the server and multiple instances run as clients. All communication happens over a network using Java Socket programming.

When the application starts, the user selects the mode of operation—server or client. The server listens on a specified port and waits for client connections. Whenever a client connects, the server creates a separate thread for that client. This multithreaded approach allows the server to handle multiple clients simultaneously without blocking other connections. Each client can send text messages to the server, and the server broadcasts those messages to all other connected clients in real time.

The project demonstrates the concept of concurrency using Java threads. Each client runs in its own thread on the server side, ensuring smooth and continuous message exchange. Input and output streams are used to send and receive messages between the server and clients. The application runs in the console, making it lightweight and easy to understand for beginners.

This project is ideal for learning core Java concepts such as multithreading, socket programming, client-server communication, and basic networking. It can be extended further by adding features like user names, private messaging, message timestamps, or a graphical user interface using Swing or JavaFX. Overall, this project provides a strong foundation for understanding real-time communication systems in Java and is suitable for academic mini-projects.

Tools Used

Java (JDK 8 or above)
Java is the primary programming language used in this project. The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides the required tools and libraries such as java.net for socket programming, java.io for input/output streams, and java.lang for multithreading support.

VS Code (Visual Studio Code)
VS Code is used as the code editor for writing, editing, and managing the Java source code. It offers features like syntax highlighting, debugging support, and extensions for Java development, which improve productivity and code readability.

Java Socket API
The Socket API enables network communication between the server and clients. Classes such as ServerSocket and Socket are used to establish connections and exchange data over TCP/IP.

Multithreading (Java Threads)
Java’s built-in threading support is used to handle multiple clients concurrently. Each client connection is managed by a separate thread, allowing real-time message exchange.

GitHub
GitHub is used for version control and project sharing. It helps in maintaining source code history, collaboration, and showcasing the project for academic or professional purposes.
